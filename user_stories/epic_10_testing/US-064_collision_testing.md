# US-064: Collision Testing

**As a** QA tester
**I want** to verify collision detection works correctly
**So that** gameplay is fair and bug-free

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Player never falls through platforms
- [ ] Player cannot clip through walls
- [ ] Stomp detection is accurate
- [ ] Damage detection is accurate
- [ ] Projectile collision is precise
- [ ] No collision bugs in any level

## Technical Notes
- Write unit tests for collision functions
- Test edge cases (corners, multiple collisions)
- Playtest all levels thoroughly
