# US-058: Particle Effects - Stomping

**As a** player
**I want** to see particles when stomping enemies
**So that** combat feels impactful

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Small particles emit when enemy stomped
- [x] Particles spread outward from impact point
- [x] Particles fade out over time
- [x] Effect is brief and doesn't lag game

## Technical Notes
- Create 5-10 small particle sprites
- Give random velocities outward
- Remove after 20-30 frames
- Use simple colored squares/circles
