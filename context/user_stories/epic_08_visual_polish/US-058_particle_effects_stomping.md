# US-058: Particle Effects - Stomping

**As a** player
**I want** to see particles when stomping enemies
**So that** combat feels impactful

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Small particles emit when enemy stomped
- [ ] Particles spread outward from impact point
- [ ] Particles fade out over time
- [ ] Effect is brief and doesn't lag game

## Technical Notes
- Create 5-10 small particle sprites
- Give random velocities outward
- Remove after 20-30 frames
- Use simple colored squares/circles
