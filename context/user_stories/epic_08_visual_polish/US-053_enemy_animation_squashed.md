# US-053: Enemy Animation - Squashed

**As a** player
**I want** to see enemies get squashed when stomped
**So that** defeating them is satisfying

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Squashed sprite shows when enemy defeated
- [x] Sprite is flattened/compressed vertically
- [x] Shows briefly before enemy disappears
- [x] Clearly conveys defeat

## Technical Notes
- Single squashed frame
- Display for 10-15 frames before removal
- Reduce height, increase width for squash effect
