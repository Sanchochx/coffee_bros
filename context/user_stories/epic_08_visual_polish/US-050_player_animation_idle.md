# US-050: Player Animation - Idle

**As a** player
**I want** to see Coffee's idle animation when standing still
**So that** the character feels alive

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Idle animation plays when not moving
- [x] Animation is subtle (breathing, blinking)
- [x] Loops seamlessly
- [x] Doesn't distract from gameplay

## Technical Notes
- Use 4-frame idle animation
- Slower cycle speed than walk (animate every 10-15 frames)
