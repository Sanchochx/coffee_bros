# US-050: Player Animation - Idle

**As a** player
**I want** to see Sancho's idle animation when standing still
**So that** the character feels alive

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Idle animation plays when not moving
- [ ] Animation is subtle (breathing, blinking)
- [ ] Loops seamlessly
- [ ] Doesn't distract from gameplay

## Technical Notes
- Use 4-frame idle animation
- Slower cycle speed than walk (animate every 10-15 frames)
