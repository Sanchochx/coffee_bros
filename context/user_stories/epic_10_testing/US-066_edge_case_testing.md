# US-066: Edge Case Testing

**As a** QA tester
**I want** to test unusual scenarios
**So that** the game handles edge cases gracefully

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multiple simultaneous collisions handled
- [ ] Powerup expiry during shooting handled
- [ ] Death during invulnerability prevented
- [ ] Pausing during transitions works
- [ ] Rapid input doesn't break game
- [ ] Boundary conditions tested (edges, corners)

## Technical Notes
- Create test cases for known edge cases
- Attempt to break game with unusual inputs
- Fix any crashes or unexpected behavior
