# US-064: Collision Testing

**As a** QA tester
**I want** to verify collision detection works correctly
**So that** gameplay is fair and bug-free

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Player never falls through platforms
- [x] Player cannot clip through walls
- [x] Stomp detection is accurate
- [x] Damage detection is accurate
- [x] Projectile collision is precise
- [x] No collision bugs in any level

## Technical Notes
- Write unit tests for collision functions
- Test edge cases (corners, multiple collisions)
- Playtest all levels thoroughly
