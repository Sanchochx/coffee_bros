# US-008: Project Structure Setup

**As a** developer
**I want** to organize code into proper modules
**So that** the codebase is maintainable

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `src/` directory contains all game modules
- [ ] `config.py` contains all game constants
- [ ] `main.py` serves as entry point
- [ ] Each class is in its own file
- [ ] `__init__.py` files exist in appropriate directories
- [ ] Code follows consistent naming conventions

## Technical Notes
- Follow project structure from implementation plan
- Use absolute imports where possible
- Keep config values separate from logic
