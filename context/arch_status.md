## Implemented Features

### Epic 5: User Interface and HUD (IN PROGRESS)
- **US-031: Score Display** ✓
  - Score display implemented on HUD in standardized format
  - **Display specifications:**
    - Format: "SCORE: 00000" with zero-padding to 5 digits
    - Location: Top-left corner at position (10, 10)
    - Font size: 36pt (default pygame font)
    - Color: White (255, 255, 255) for high contrast against backgrounds
    - Always visible and fixed on screen (not affected by camera scrolling)
  - **Score tracking:**
    - Updates immediately when points earned (no delay)
    - Enemy defeat: +100 points (STOMP_SCORE constant)
    - Powerup collection: +50 points (POWERUP_SCORE constant)
    - Laser kill: +100 points (same as stomp)
    - Score tracked in main game loop (main.py line 26)
  - **Score persistence:**
    - Score persists across all level transitions
    - Carries over from Level 1 through Level 5
    - Only resets to 0 on player death (lives = 0)
    - Only resets to 0 on game restart from victory screen (R key)
    - level_start_score tracks score at beginning of each level for transition screen
  - **Zero-padding implementation:**
    - Uses Python f-string format: f"SCORE: {score:05d}"
    - :05d formats integer with zero-padding to 5 digits minimum width
    - Examples: 0 → "SCORE: 00000", 150 → "SCORE: 00150", 12345 → "SCORE: 12345"
    - Handles scores beyond 99999 by expanding width automatically
  - **HUD positioning:**
    - Score at (10, 10) - top-left corner
    - Lives display in top-right - implemented in US-032
    - Powerup timer at (10, 50) when active - to be improved in US-033
    - HUD elements rendered after all sprites to appear on top
    - HUD rendering uses screen coordinates (not affected by camera_x offset)
  - **Integration with existing systems:**
    - Works with score tracking from Epic 2 (US-011, US-012)
    - Works with powerup collection from Epic 3 (US-017)
    - Works with laser kills from Epic 3 (US-020)
    - Displays correctly during level transitions (US-029)
    - Displays correctly on victory screen (US-030)
    - Compatible with camera system (US-038, US-039) - HUD unaffected by scrolling
  - **Visual quality:**
    - Clearly readable with white text on varied backgrounds
    - Standardized format (SCORE: 00000) provides professional appearance
    - Consistent placement in top-left makes it easy to find
    - Font size 36 is large enough for clear visibility during gameplay
  - **Code location:**
    - main.py lines 320-322: Score rendering logic
    - Uses font initialized at line 27 (pygame.font.Font(None, 36))
    - Score variable initialized at line 26 and updated throughout game loop
  - **Future improvements (later user stories):**
    - US-033 will improve Powerup timer display formatting
    - US-034 will add main menu
    - US-035 will add pause menu
    - Epic 8 may add visual polish to HUD elements

- **US-032: Lives Display** ✓
  - Lives display implemented on HUD in compact "x3" format positioned in top-right corner
  - **Display specifications:**
    - Format: "x3" (shows remaining lives count with 'x' prefix)
    - Location: Top-right corner with 10px margin from right edge
    - Position: topright = (WINDOW_WIDTH - 10, 10) using pygame rect positioning
    - Font size: 36pt (default pygame font, same as score display)
    - Color: White (255, 255, 255) for high contrast and consistency with score
    - Always visible and fixed on screen (not affected by camera scrolling)
  - **Lives tracking:**
    - Displays player.lives variable which is updated by game systems
    - Updates immediately when life is lost (no delay or animation required)
    - Lives decremented at main.py line 287 when player falls into pit
    - Lives decremented by player.take_damage() method when hit by enemy
    - Initial lives set by PLAYER_STARTING_LIVES constant (default: 3)
  - **Display behavior:**
    - Shows during all normal gameplay (not during transition/victory screens)
    - Rendered every frame - automatically reflects current lives count
    - No caching or buffering - instant visual update when lives change
    - Positioned using get_rect() for precise right-alignment
  - **Visual design rationale:**
    - "x3" format is compact and universally understood (game convention)
    - Top-right placement balances score in top-left, creating symmetric HUD
    - White color maintains consistency with other HUD elements
    - Right-aligned text prevents shifting when lives count changes (3→2→1)
    - 10px margin prevents text from touching screen edge
  - **HUD layout with US-032:**
    - Top-left (10, 10): Score display "SCORE: 00000"
    - Top-right (WIDTH-10, 10): Lives display "x3"
    - Left side (10, 50): Powerup timer when active (below score)
    - Balanced layout with information spread across top of screen
    - Player can see critical info (lives, score) with peripheral vision during gameplay
  - **Integration with existing systems:**
    - Works with lives system from Epic 2 (US-013, US-014)
    - Displays lives tracked by player.take_damage() (US-012)
    - Shows lives lost from pit falls (US-015)
    - Updates during respawn and death mechanics
    - Compatible with camera system (US-038, US-039) - HUD unaffected by scrolling
    - Displays correctly during all game states (gameplay, level completion)
  - **Code location:**
    - main.py lines 324-328: Lives rendering logic with right-alignment
    - Uses font initialized at line 27 (pygame.font.Font(None, 36))
    - player.lives variable read from Player entity
    - Rendered after sprites but before overlay screens (proper z-ordering)
  - **Technical implementation details:**
    - lives_text = font.render(f"x{player.lives}", True, (255, 255, 255))
    - lives_rect = lives_text.get_rect() to get text bounding box
    - lives_rect.topright = (WINDOW_WIDTH - 10, 10) for right-alignment
    - screen.blit(lives_text, lives_rect) to render at calculated position
    - Right-alignment ensures text stays in same visual position regardless of digit count
  - **Acceptance criteria verification:**
    - ✓ Lives displayed in top-right of screen
    - ✓ Shows in "x3" format (compact and clear)
    - ✓ Updates immediately when life lost (rendered every frame)
    - ✓ Remains visible at all times during gameplay
    - ✓ Uses clear iconography ("x" prefix is standard gaming convention)
  - **Future improvements (later user stories):**
    - US-033 may adjust positioning if powerup timer layout changes
    - Epic 8 may add heart icons or visual polish to lives display
    - Epic 7 may add sound effects when lives change (already implemented for damage)

### Epic 6: Camera and Viewport (COMPLETED EARLY - Critical Fix)
- **US-038: Scrolling Camera Implementation** ✓
  - Camera system implemented to make levels playable (levels wider than screen)
  - **Critical issue resolved:** All 5 levels are 3200-6000 pixels wide but screen is only 800px
  - Without camera, goal flags were unreachable (off-screen to the right)
  - **Camera tracking:**
    - camera_x variable tracks horizontal camera offset
    - Camera centers on player: camera_x = player.rect.centerx - WINDOW_WIDTH // 2
    - Updated every frame before rendering
    - Smooth following - no sudden jumps or jittering
  - **Sprite rendering with offset:**
    - All sprites rendered with camera offset applied
    - For each sprite: offset_rect = sprite.rect.copy(), offset_rect.x -= camera_x
    - Screen space rendering: world position converted to screen position
    - HUD elements unaffected (always on-screen)
  - **Camera reset points:**
    - Reset to 0 when loading new level
    - Reset to 0 when restarting from victory screen
    - Reset to 0 when respawning from death
    - Ensures player always starts with camera at level beginning
  - **Integration with existing systems:**
    - Works seamlessly with level progression (US-025, US-029)
    - Compatible with all 5 levels (US-024 through US-028)
    - No changes needed to sprite classes (offset applied during rendering)
    - HUD remains fixed on screen (not affected by camera)

- **US-039: Camera Boundaries** ✓
  - Camera clamping system prevents showing empty space outside levels
  - **Boundary calculation:**
    - Reads level width from level.metadata["width"]
    - max_camera_x = max(0, level_width - WINDOW_WIDTH)
    - Handles levels smaller than screen width (max_camera_x = 0, no scrolling)
  - **Camera clamping:**
    - camera_x clamped to [0, max_camera_x] every frame
    - Prevents scrolling past left edge (x=0)
    - Prevents scrolling past right edge (max_camera_x)
    - Smooth stopping at boundaries (no jarring stops)
  - **Player movement at edges:**
    - Player can still move freely near level edges
    - Camera stops scrolling but player continues moving
    - Player can reach leftmost and rightmost areas of level
    - No invisible walls or movement restrictions
  - **Visual quality:**
    - No black bars or empty space visible at any time
    - Entire screen always filled with level content
    - Professional appearance with proper boundaries
  - **Level-specific boundaries:**
    - Level 1 (Coffee Hills): 0 to 2400 (3200 - 800)
    - Level 2 (Mountain Paths): 0 to 3200 (4000 - 800)
    - Level 3 (Bean Valley): 0 to 4000 (4800 - 800)
    - Level 4 (Harvest Heights): 0 to 4200 (5000 - 800)
    - Level 5 (El Pico del Café): 0 to 5200 (6000 - 800)
  - **Benefits:**
    - All levels now fully explorable and playable
    - Goal flags reachable in all 5 levels
    - Level progression system functional
    - Game playthrough now possible from Level 1 to victory screen
