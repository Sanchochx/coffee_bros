# COFFEE BROS - GAME DESCRIPTION

**Welcome to Coffee Bros!**

In the vibrant highlands of Colombia, a legendary coffee farmer named **Coffee** must embark on an epic quest to save his village's precious coffee harvest from the mischievous **Polochos** - pesky bean-stealing creatures that have invaded the land!

## THE HERO
**Coffee** - A brave Colombian coffee farmer with a thick mustache and a determination as strong as his espresso. Armed with nothing but his courage and incredible jumping skills, Coffee must traverse dangerous terrain to restore peace to his homeland.

## THE ENEMIES
**Polochos** - Troublesome little pests that waddle across the ground, getting in Coffee's way. They may look harmless, but one touch from these coffee bean bandits will send Coffee tumbling! However, Coffee can defeat them the traditional way: **jump on their heads** to squash them flat, just like stomping a coffee cherry at harvest time!

## THE POWER-UP
**La Arepa Dorada** (The Golden Arepa) - A mystical Colombian corn cake that grants Coffee an extraordinary power! When consumed, Coffee channels the energy of a thousand morning coffees and can shoot **laser beams** from his hands! No more jumping required - now you can blast through Polochos from a distance and clear your path with caffeinated firepower!

## THE QUEST
Navigate through **5 increasingly challenging levels**, each filled with:
- Treacherous **pits and fall zones** - one wrong step means starting over!
- **Floating platforms** to test your jumping precision
- **Solid blocks** to climb and navigate
- Swarms of Polochos blocking your path - defeat them by stomping or shooting!

**¡Buena suerte, Coffee! The coffee harvest depends on you!**
